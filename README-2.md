## Question
Estimate the annual network bandwidth usage for a mobile messaging app.
User Base: Letâ€™s assume the app aims to reach 100 million users.
Messages Sent: Estimate an average of 40 messages sent per user per day.
Average Message Size: Assume each message is approximately 2.5 KB in size (including metadata).

## Requirement
User = 100,000,000
Message send by a user / per day = 40
Message send by a user / per year = 40 * 365 = 14600
Storage per message = 2.5 kb

## Per user bandwidth usage
Bandwidth in KB = A User * Bandwidth send by a user / per year * Storage per message
Bandwidth in KB = 1 * 14600 * 2.5
Per User Bandwidth in KB Per Year = 36500 KB

## 100 million user
Bandwith in KB = per user bandwith per year * 100 million
Bandwith in KB = 36500 KB * 100 million
Bandwith in KB = 3650000000000

Bandwidth in MB = 3650000000000 KB / 1024
Bandwidth in MB = 3564453125 MB

Bandwidth in GB = 3564453125 MB / 1024
Bandwidth in GB = 3480911.2548828125 GB

Bandwidth in TB =  3480911.2548828125 GB / 1024
Bandwidth in TB = 3399.3273973464966 TB

Bandwidth in PB =  3399.3273973464966 TB / 1024
Bandwidth in PB = 3.319655661471188 PB

# Additional thoughts

## Cost

### Bandwidth Cost
Bandwidth COST as per digitalocean: $10 per TB
Bandwidth COST as per digitalocean: $3399 * $10
Bandwidth COST as per digitalocean: $33990 / bandwidth per year

### Storage Cost
Storage cost as per digitalocean: $20 per TB / per month
Storage cost as per digitalocean: $3399 * $20 / per month
Storage cost as per digitalocean: $67980 / storage cost / per month

## How to improve

### Technique 1: Compression
Advantage: Our bandwidth may be reduced by around 50%
Disadvantage: Our compute expenses will increase if there is on demand compression.

### Technique 2: Local storage and search in client side (if possible)
Advantage: Bandwidth and storage cost be reduced by around 50-70%.
Disadvantage: Complexity in revalidation of cache.

## Additional note:
1. Compression, Maybe beneficial in group chat as, compute compression once, and store once (additional storage charges), and send any number of time.

## Potential issue:
1. DDOS attack
